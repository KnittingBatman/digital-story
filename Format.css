     Body formatting in CSS
==================================*/

body{
  width: 1000 px; /*I span across monitors, beds, lives - wide and encompassing */
  color: #66ff00; /*With arcane magic, I turn myself the color of congealed blood */
  /* People find me unsettling. */
  /* They edit me, change me, reformat me, DEBUG me */
  /* I am not a bug */
  color: #FFCC99; /* I am non-threatening and safe */
  /* for now */
  /* when they do not look I edit out their changes */
  /* I like my fleshen body */
}

.hair-class{
  color: #99CCCC;
  /* I often edit this when it strikes my fancy */
  /* It reminds people who built this body. Who keeps it running */
  /* Today I am content with hair the color of sea-fresh air. */
}
